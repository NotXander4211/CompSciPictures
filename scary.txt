The Last RoomMara always loved exploring abandoned places, but the old Greyford Hotel was different. It felt alive, pulsing with an invisible energy. She wandered through the dusty halls, snapping photos of crumbling wallpaper and shattered mirrors.On the third floor, she found Room 309. Its door was pristine, as if someone had just replaced it. Oddly drawn to it, Mara turned the knob.The room was untouched by time: a neatly made bed, a vase of fresh flowers, and a faint smell of lavender. A journal lay open on the desk. It wasn’t dusty like the rest of the hotel.“Whoever enters must stay. They are watching.”Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind her. Mara's flashlight flickered. Whispering rose from the corners of the room, low and guttural.Panicked, she pulled at the door, but it wouldn’t budge. Her phone buzzed—it was a notification for a photo she didn’t take. On her screen was a picture of her standing in the doorway, a shadowy figure looming behind her.When the rescue team arrived weeks later, the room was empty. The journal’s pages were blank, except for the last one:“Another guest has joined us.”
