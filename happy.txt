The Unexpected Garden

Lucy had always dreamed of having her own garden, but the apartment she rented had no space for flowers. Instead, she spent her days admiring plants at the local nursery, where she would often talk with the owner, Mr. Green, about her love for gardening.

One afternoon, Mr. Green surprised her with a small potted plant. “For your future garden,” he said with a smile. “It’s a gift.”

Lucy took the plant home, carefully placing it on her windowsill. She didn’t have much, but she watered it every day, nurturing it with love. Weeks passed, and her little plant grew. Soon, it sprouted flowers—bright, vibrant petals in colors Lucy had never imagined.

Neighbors began to stop by and admire the beautiful blooms. Before long, Lucy’s small windowsill garden became a community project. People brought seeds, pots, and plants, all excited to see what would grow.

One sunny afternoon, as she sat in her little garden, surrounded by the joy of her neighbors, Lucy realized that sometimes, the best things grow from small beginnings.
